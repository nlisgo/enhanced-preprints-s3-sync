 <p>All statistical analyses were executed using GraphPad Prism 6 software. Sample size and statistical tests performed are provided in the Figure legends. For Dunnett&#x2019;s post hoc analyses, the experimental group was compared to all controls and the highest p-value reported over the experimental bar. Replicates are biological replicates, using different individual flies from 2 or more crosses. Sample sizes were based on previous experiments in which effect size was determined. Data was excluded on the basis of STROBE technical malfunctions for individual flies and criteria for data exclusion are as follows: i) if the light system was not working during training for individual arenas ii) if during training or testing a fly did not meet a standard minimum # of interactions for that genotype iii) if during training or testing the STROBE recorded an abnormally large # of interactions for that genotype iiii) technical malfunctions due to high channel capacitance baseline activity v) if a fly was dead in an arena.</p>
